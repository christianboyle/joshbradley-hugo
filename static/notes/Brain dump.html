<p>
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing control of my mind. It just does what it wants and it can be difficult to manage.
</p>

<p>
Happy, sad, who knows but it. I choose lonliness more often than not beacuse it is easier. To manage it and others is a burden that I often don't have energy for.
</p>

<p>
It wants to do it's thing. It wants to explore ideas on it's time on it's terms and I get dragged around behind it.
</p>

<p>
Angered by those who try to control it, it is like a teenager rebelling.
</p>

<p>
There is a darkness to it. Some leviathan circling, collecting negativity as food urging me to do nothing, collapse, stop and submit to it.
</p>

<p>
And yet in the cracks of this chaos lies beauty.
</p>

<p>
Trains of ideas so fluid and interconnected one wants to lose themself to their sheer brilliance.
</p>

<p>
They exist somehow on their own without my guidance, inspiring me to do something, anything big.
</p>

<p>
However I skim across the surface in my limited understanding of the world. The more I learn, the more I must adjust my model and recongize that once again, I was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Yet there are times where it seems like there is enough of an idea to go from, some acorn ready to sow.
</p>

<p>
But once again they breathe with that same chaotic life, wrenching my focus away from evrything but itself.
</p>

<p>
The madness is linked in that mechanism. Finding the balance between my selves will almost lead to treasure.
</p>

<p>
In those cracks is also an urge to create. <a href="To build something marvelous, worthy of millions..html">To build something marvelous, worthy of millions.</a>
</p>

<p>
Those ideas float with my surface level understanding, but might lead to some economic success.
</p>

<p>
If I want to do a speed test I might as well do it here and do it properly.
</p>

<p>
This is unfortunately difficult to do.
</p>

<p>
What the fuck. I do need to stretch more because my right arm is feeling very weak, as if on the verge of giving up.
</p>

<p>
It's honestly incredible that Procore is going public tomorrow. It's something that has loomed in my life for 4 years and now it feels that my effort is in coming to fruition. In some small way.
</p>

<p>
It is rewarding but also disappointing to know that I didn't get as much as many others.
</p>

<p>
At the very least it has given me fundamental experience that will go a long way.

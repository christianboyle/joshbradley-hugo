I aspire to be a master of the web. From wireframing information architectures, creating responsive designs, programming on full-stack frameworks, to analyzing web data, and personalizing based on insights. Here is the work I have completed in pursuit of that goal.

## 2020

### Procore Modules

{{< figure src="/images/procore-modules-examples-solutions-hero-image-news.png" title="Procore Modules – Solutions Hero" link="https://mkt-cdn.procore.com/procore-modules-examples/solutions-hero-image-news.html" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*Vanilla JavaScript and CSS*

To support Procore's effort to unify its brand from website to application, I began working with our web designer to develop modules free of any dependencies that could easily be imported and used on any website.

**Result:** Beautiful, well-documented modules that don't rely on 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries to unify Procore's brand.

### The Jobsite by Procore

{{< figure src="/images/www-procore-com-jobsite.png" title="Jobsite by Procore – Homepage" link="https://www.procore.com/jobsite/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*WordPress, React*

I designed and developed a custom WordPress theme for Jobsite that made use of the Gutenberg editor to create an intuitive CMS experience that supported excellent technical SEO and load times while aligning the website with Procore's brand.

**Result:** 7.5x improvement in load time (from 30s to 4s) with a vastly better user experience on both the front and back end.

### Property Management Prototype

{{< figure src="/images/property-management.png" title="Property Management Prototype" link="http://rt-properties-staging.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*AWS, React, Flux*

As an exercise in mastering React, I worked with a friend to create a property management application. Taking advantage of modern best practices the {{< externallink "front end code" "https://github.com/joshuabradley012/property-management" >}} features code splitting, lazy loading, and global state management. The {{< externallink "back end" "https://github.com/joshuabradley012/property-management-lambda" >}} is an OLAP API built on AWS's serverless architecture.

**Result:** (Incomplete) A much deeper understanding of building scalable React applications.

### Remodeling Prototype

{{< figure src="/images/remodeler.png" title="Remodeling Prototype" link="http://remodeler.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*React*

I built this prototype with a business partner as a proof of concept for an idea we had developed. The source code can be found {{< externallink "here" "https://github.com/joshuabradley012/remodeler" >}}

**Result:** (Incomplete) Several custom components and a deeper mastery of React Router.


### Brian D. Mahan

{{< figure src="/images/www-briandmahan-com.png" title="Brian D. Mahan – Homepage" link="https://www.briandmahan.com/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*WebFlow*

I redesigned and developed Brian's website as the first step towards conversion rate optimization.

**Result:** A redesigned website that is faster and much easier to navigate that led to a large increase in inbound patients.


### Breast Cancer Resource Center Blog

{{< figure src="/images/www-bcrcsb-org.png" title="Breast Cancer Resource Center – Blog" link="https://www.bcrcsb.org/blog/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*WordPress*

A designer contracted me for a simple freelance job to implement his blog design in WordPress. The theme is fully custom.

**Result:** A beautiful blog for the Breast Cancer Resource Center to showcase their inspirational stories.

### Experimentation at Procore

{{< figure src="/images/adobe-target.png" title="Adobe Target Logo" link="/images/adobe-target.png" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*Adobe Target, Magnolia, Demandbase*

With a solid web analytics foundation, I spearheaded the effort to begin optimizing our top pages implementing Adobe Target, and strategizing our early roadmap.

**Result:** A 167% improvement in organic conversions over 6 months.

### Web Analytics at Procore

{{< figure src="/images/adobe-analytics.png" title="Adobe Analytics Logo" link="/images/adobe-analytics.png" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Adobe Launch*

Starting with a very basic Google Analytics instance, I scaled web reporting creating a highly accurate, GDPR compliant implementation. When leadership recognized the need for an enterprise solution I spearheaded the migration to Adobe Analytics.

**Result:** A web analytics solution capable of tracking hundreds of datapoints, deeply integrated with sales and marketing data.

### SEO at Procore

{{< figure src="/images/google.png" title="Google Logo" link="/images/google.png" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*BrightEdge, AHREFs, Search Console*

As Procore's first SEO I laid the foundation for their SEO and helped scale the effort across 4 international regions.

**Result:** A rock-solid technical foundation, in-depth reporting, and a marketing department that understands SEO basics.

## 2017

### Epoch Microelectronics

{{< figure src="/images/www-epochmicro-com.png" title="Epoch Microelectronics – Homepage" link="https://www.epochmicro.com/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*WordPress, Bootstrap*

I led a team of 4 to create a website to showcase Epoch Microelectronic's extensive IP catalog, and drive leads.

**Result:** An elegant, modern theme to present their brand in the best light.

### Handelman Studios

{{< figure src="/images/www-stevenhandelmanstudios-com.png" title="Steven Handelman Studios Homepage – About Section" link="https://www.stevenhandelmanstudios.com/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap*

I led a team of 4 to migrate a legacy, custom eCommerce solution to WooCommerce. Over 2000 products had to be transformed into the new schema with a PHP script.

**Result:** A modernized digital storefront that led to much higher sales through an intuitive experience.

NOTE: Since launching, several low-quality modifications have been made, although the base remains.

### Pacifica Graduate Institute

{{< figure src="/images/www-pacifica-edu.png" title="Pacifica Graduate Institute – Homepage" link="https://www.pacifica.edu/" target="blank" class="shadow ratio-16by9" >}}

*WordPress, Advanced Custom Fields, Bootstrap*

I was the junior engineer on a pair project to modernize Pacifica Graduate Institute's website with a refreshed design and scalable CMS. Partnering closely with their technology and admissions team, we developed a custom WordPress theme using Advanced Custom Fields and Bootstrap.

**Result:** A website that reflected PGI's values while making key information highly visible for all types of users.

Paul Graham wrote his influential post on LISP in 2008. I first read it in 2018 and was immediately captured by the proposed power of LISP.

At the time, I did not understand what made the language so powerful. Fast forwards two years, and I still don't.

But that didn't stop me from trying to trace his steps and recreate what John McCarthy had discovered to see what Paul saw so many years ago.
